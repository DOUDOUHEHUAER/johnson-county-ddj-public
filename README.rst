Johnson County Early Intervention System
========================================

DSSG has partnered with Johnson County and Salt Lake County to build a
prototype early intervention system (EIS) for individuals who repeatedly
cycle through multiple systems, including jails, EMS, mental health
services. Currently, there is little coordination between systems to
address each person's underlying needs. An accurate Early Intervention
System will quickly identify individuals at risk of contact with any or
all systems so our partners can provide appropriate services and
interventions to them.

To achieve this goal, we developed models that assign risk scores to
individuals making contact with one system of making future contact with
another system. These models produce ranked lists of individuals at risk
who may receive follow-up care or interventions. The models provide
proactive risk warnings at points of contact (e.g., EMS dispatch, jail
bookings).

The paper `Reducing Incarceration through Prioritized Interventions
<https://dssg.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/reducing-incarceration-prioritized.pdf>`_
is under review and provides a more in-depth description of the project's
implementation and its results. More specific documentation of the code itself
can be built with Sphinx by `make -C doc html` or the public documentation may
